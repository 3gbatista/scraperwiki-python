Local ScraperWiki Python Library
====
This library aims to be a drop-in replacement for the Python `scraperwiki` library
for use locally. That is, functions will work the same way, and data will go
into a local SQLite database; a targeted bombing of ScraperWiki's servers
will not stop this local library from working, unless you happen to be running
it on one of ScraperWiki's servers.

## Documentation

Read the standard ScraperWiki Python library's [documentation](docs),
then look below for some quirks about the local version.

## Quirks

The local library aims to be a drop-in replacement.
In reality, the local version sometimes works better,
though not all of the features have been implemented.

## Differences

### Datastore differences

The local `scraperwiki.sqlite` is powered by
[DumpTruck](http://dumptruck.io), so some things
work a bit differently.

Data are stored to a local sqlite database named `dumptruck.db`.

Bizarre table and column names are supported.

Dates and datetimes are stored in a different standard format.

`scraperwiki.sqlite.execute` returns lists of dictionaries.

`scraperwiki.sqlite.attach` downloads the whole datastore from ScraperWiki,
So you might not want to use this too often on large databases.

`scraperwiki.sqlite.get_var` and `scraperwiki.sqlite.save_var`
store their data in the table `_dumptruckvars`, and they use
a slightly different format.

### Other Differences

## Status of implementation
In general, features that have not been implemented raise a `NotImplementedError`.

### Datastore
`scraperwiki.sqlite` is missing the following features.

* Data argument to `scraperwiki.sqlite.select`
* All of the `verbose` keyword arguments (These control what is printed on the ScraperWiki code editor)
* `scraperwiki.sqlite.show_tables` only works for the main database is implemented.

### Everything else
Nothing else is implemented yet.
