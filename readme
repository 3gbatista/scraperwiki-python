Local ScraperWiki Python Library
====
This library aims to be a drop-in replacement for the Python `scraperwiki` library
for use locally. That is, functions will work the same way, and data will go
into a local SQLite database; a targeted bombing of ScraperWiki's servers
will not stop this local library from working, unless you happen to be running
it on one of ScraperWiki's servers.

**This is no longer the canonical repository**; use [this one](https://github.com/scraperwiki/dumptruck).

## Installing

This will soon be in PyPI, but for now you can just install from the git repository.

## Documentation

Read the standard ScraperWiki Python library's [documentation](https://scraperwiki.com/docs/python/python_help_documentation/),
then look below for some quirks about the local version.

## Quirks

The local library aims to be a drop-in replacement.
In reality, the local version sometimes works better,
though not all of the features have been implemented.

## Differences

### Datastore differences

The local `scraperwiki.sqlite` is powered by
[DumpTruck](http://dumptruck.io), so some things
work a bit differently.

Data are stored to a local sqlite database named `scraperwiki.db`.

Bizarre table and column names are supported.

Dates and datetimes are stored in a different standard format.

`scraperwiki.sqlite.execute` returns lists of dictionaries.

`scraperwiki.sqlite.attach` downloads the whole datastore from ScraperWiki,
So you might not want to use this too often on large databases.

`scraperwiki.sqlite.get_var` and `scraperwiki.sqlite.save_var`
store their data in the table `_dumptruckvars`, and they use
a slightly different format.

### Other Differences

## Status of implementation
In general, features that have not been implemented raise a `NotImplementedError`.

### Datastore
`scraperwiki.sqlite` is missing the following features.

* Data argument to `scraperwiki.sqlite.select`
* All of the `verbose` keyword arguments (These control what is printed on the ScraperWiki code editor)
* `scraperwiki.sqlite.show_tables` only works for the main database is implemented.

### Geo
The UK geocoding helpers have not been implemented

* `scraperwiki.geo`

<!-- They have also been released as a separate library (ukgeo). Not true yet. -->

### Utils
`scraperwiki.utils` is implemented, as well as the following functions.

* `scraperwiki.log`
* `scraperwiki.scrape`
* `scraperwiki.pdftoxml`
* `scraperwiki.swimport`

### Deprecated
These submodules are deprecated and thus will not be implemented.

* `scraperwiki.apiwrapper`
* `scraperwiki.datastore`
* `scraperwiki.jsqlite`
* `scraperwiki.metadata`
* `scraperwiki.newsql`

### Development

Run tests with `./runtests`; this small wrapper cleans up after itself.
