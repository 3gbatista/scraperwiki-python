Local ScraperWiki Python Library
====
This library aims to be a drop-in replacement for the Python `scraperwiki` library
for use locally. That is, functions will work the same way, and data will go
into a local SQLite database; a targeted bombing of ScraperWiki's servers
will not stop this local library from working, unless you happen to be running
it on one of ScraperWiki's servers.

## Documentation

Read the standard ScraperWiki Python library's [documentation](docs),
then look below for some quirks about the local version.
